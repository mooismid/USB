            <h1>USB Type C</h1>
                <p> Developed to support devices with a smaller, thinner and lighter form factor. Type-C is slim enough for a smartphone or tablet, yet robust enough for a laptop computer.
                    In fact, many new laptops have eliminated USB-A and RJ45 Ethernet ports and offer USB-C as
                    the only port for video, network, data transfer and charging. This has prompted other
                    protocols, including Thunderboltâ„¢ 3, DisplayPort, MHL, and HDMI, to adopt USB-C as their
                    standard source connector.
                    Alternate Modes allow the data pins on a USB Type-C connector to carry other types of
                    signals. For example, DisplayPort Alt Mode (also referred to as DP Alt Mode) allows a USB-C
                    cable to connect a DP-enabled laptop or tablet directly to a TV or computer monitor with a 
                    USB-C port.The USB-C Type 2.1 specification (announced May, 2021) increases the power capacity 
                    of cables and connectors from 100W to 240W, making it possible to power and charge larger, 
                    power-hungry devices such as 4K monitors, e-bikes and gaming laptops.</p>
